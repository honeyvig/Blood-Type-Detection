# Blood-Type-Detection
To detect blood types using AI and automated sensors, you'll need a system that uses machine learning models to analyze sensor data or images and determine blood type classifications. While there is no standard, off-the-shelf solution that works directly with blood type classification, you can develop an AI system based on image recognition or sensor data if your sensors provide useful features like color, patterns, or chemical reactions related to blood typing.
Basic Approach

We'll assume you have some data (e.g., images of blood samples reacting to blood typing reagents or sensor readings that correlate with specific blood types). For the sake of this example, let’s focus on two approaches:

    Image-based classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): This method can use a camera or microscope to capture images of blood samples and classify the blood type.
    Sensor-based classification using sensor data: You could collect various sensor data such as pH levels, absorbance, or other chemical reactions from a sensor when blood is mixed with typing reagents.

Steps for Image-based Blood Type Detection using a CNN:

    Prepare a Dataset: The dataset should contain images of blood samples with known blood types. Ideally, these images would show blood samples after being mixed with blood typing reagents.

    Train a CNN for Image Classification: We will use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the blood type based on images. A CNN is effective for image data because it can automatically learn the spatial hierarchies of patterns in images.

    Preprocess the Images: Resize images, normalize pixel values, and possibly augment the data to handle variations in blood samples.

    Train the Model: Train the CNN using labeled blood type images (A, B, AB, O, etc.).

    Predict Blood Type: Use the trained model to predict blood types from new images.

Example Python Code for Image-based Blood Type Detection

We'll use the TensorFlow and Keras libraries for building the CNN.

2. Code for Blood Type Classification (Image-based Approach)

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np
import cv2
import os
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load your dataset of blood type images (Assumed format: 'A', 'B', 'AB', 'O' as subfolders)
def load_data(image_dir):
    images = []
    labels = []
    label_map = {'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'AB': 2, 'O': 3}  # Mapping blood type to numeric labels

    for label in os.listdir(image_dir):
        label_folder = os.path.join(image_dir, label)
        if os.path.isdir(label_folder):
            for image_file in os.listdir(label_folder):
                image_path = os.path.join(label_folder, image_file)
                img = cv2.imread(image_path)  # Read image
                img = cv2.resize(img, (128, 128))  # Resize image to 128x128 pixels
                img = img.astype('float32') / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values
                images.append(img)
                labels.append(label_map[label])

    return np.array(images), np.array(labels)

# Load images and labels
image_dir = 'path_to_your_blood_samples_dataset'  # Directory where images are stored
images, labels = load_data(image_dir)

# Split dataset into training and testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(images, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build the CNN model for blood type classification
def build_model():
    model = models.Sequential()
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 3)))
    model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
    model.add(layers.Flatten())
    model.add(layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'))
    model.add(layers.Dense(4, activation='softmax'))  # 4 classes: A, B, AB, O
    return model

# Compile the model
model = build_model()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Save the model
model.save('blood_type_classifier.h5')

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Function to predict blood type from a new image
def predict_blood_type(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    img = cv2.resize(img, (128, 128))
    img = img.astype('float32') / 255.0
    img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)  # Add batch dimension
    prediction = model.predict(img)
    class_index = np.argmax(prediction)
    blood_types = ['A', 'B', 'AB', 'O']
    return blood_types[class_index]

# Test prediction on a new image
new_image_path = 'path_to_new_blood_image.jpg'  # Path to a new image for prediction
predicted_blood_type = predict_blood_type(new_image_path)
print(f"Predicted Blood Type: {predicted_blood_type}")

Explanation of the Code:

    Loading the Dataset:
        We assume you have a directory where each subfolder represents a blood type (e.g., A, B, AB, O) and contains images of blood samples.
        We load these images, resize them to 128x128, and normalize the pixel values to be between 0 and 1.

    Model Construction:
        The CNN model consists of three convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers.
        The output layer uses a softmax activation with 4 classes corresponding to blood types: A, B, AB, and O.

    Model Training:
        We use sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss function (suitable for multi-class classification) and the Adam optimizer.
        The model is trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.

    Prediction:
        After training, you can use the model to predict blood types from new images by resizing them to the input size of the model and passing them through the trained network.

3. Sensor-based Blood Type Detection

If you are using sensors to determine blood types, the process would involve:

    Collecting sensor data: Data could be based on sensor readings of blood samples after they interact with specific typing reagents (e.g., optical sensors measuring color changes).
    Training a Model: Use machine learning techniques to classify the blood type based on the sensor readings.

For this, you could use regression or classification models, such as Random Forest or Support Vector Machines (SVM), depending on the complexity of your sensor data.
Example Python Code for Sensor-based Blood Type Detection

Here’s an example of how you might implement a simple machine learning model to classify blood types based on sensor data (e.g., sensor readings or feature vectors):

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import numpy as np
import pickle

# Example sensor data (Features could be pH, absorbance, etc.)
# X = sensor features, Y = blood types (0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = AB, 3 = O)
X = np.array([[7.1, 0.5, 1.2], [7.0, 0.4, 1.1], [6.9, 0.6, 1.4], [7.2, 0.5, 1.3]])  # Example features
Y = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])  # Corresponding blood types (A, B, AB, O)

# Train a Random Forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X, Y)

# Save the model
with open('blood_type_sensor_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)

# Predict blood type from new sensor data
def predict_blood_type_sensor(sensor_data):
    # Load the trained model
    with open('blood_type_sensor_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
        model = pickle.load(f)
    
    prediction = model.predict([sensor_data])
    blood_types = ['A', 'B', 'AB', 'O']
    return blood_types[prediction[0]]

# Example prediction
new_sensor_data = [7.1, 0.5, 1.2]  # New sensor data
predicted_blood_type = predict_blood_type_sensor(new_sensor_data)
print(f"Predicted Blood Type: {predicted_blood_type}")

Conclusion:

    Image-based Approach: Using a CNN, you can classify blood types based on images of blood samples.
    Sensor-based Approach: You can also use machine learning techniques like Random Forest or SVM to classify blood types based on sensor data.
    Both methods can be tailored to your specific data and sensor setup. If you have access to real-world sensor data or images, this approach can help automate blood typing processes.
